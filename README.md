# eyun

**eyun** is a fresh, green-forward Vim colorscheme designed for clarity, balance, and long-term comfort.

It uses a softly tinted dark background and a restrained palette built around greens and gentle accent colors. Syntax elements are clearly separated without relying on harsh contrast, allowing code to remain readable and calm during extended editing sessions.

eyun is built for **classic Vim** and works out of the box with Vim’s default syntax highlighting.
